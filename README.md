# Hey there 👋


I'm Braydon - a developer and innovator who bridges healthcare technology, AI automation, and financial modeling. Currently transforming how we think about medical data intelligence while building the next generation of AI-driven development workflows.

## What I'm working on now

**🏥 Healthcare Innovation at LDA**: Leading the transformation of clinical decision support with our LongView platform - turning archived medical data from a compliance burden into clinical intelligence. We're pushing the boundaries of what's possible when you combine 20+ years of healthcare data with modern AI capabilities.

**🤖 AI Development Automation**: Deep in the trenches building multi-agent development systems that can take a product requirements document and generate complete applications with tests, documentation, and deployment configs. Think AutoGen meets real-world software delivery - it's both fascinating and occasionally terrifying how well this works.

**💰 Financial Modeling for Film/TV**: Currently 75% through building a Python framework for production company financial analysis. The entertainment industry runs on spreadsheets and handshake deals - we're bringing some mathematical rigor to the chaos with 88% test coverage (because money math better be right).

**📝 Knowledge Management Systems**: Perfecting my Obsidian → Jekyll → GitHub Pages workflow for thought-to-publication automation. There's something deeply satisfying about writing once and having your ideas flow seamlessly to your blog without fighting with formatting.

## How I think about technology

I've been building things since the late 90s when I was an Internet Engineer at Fidelity (HTML 1.1 was cutting edge!). Twenty years later, I believe the best technology disappears into the background and just works. Whether it's clinical decision support saving lives or AI agents writing better code than humans, the magic happens when complexity becomes simple.

My approach: Test-driven development, modular architecture, and quality gates everywhere. If it's not tested, it's broken. If it's not modular, it's unmaintainable. And if the AI can't understand it, neither can the next developer.

## Beyond the code

When I'm not deep in healthcare data lakes or debugging multi-agent conversations, I'm usually thinking about how technology can solve real problems for real people. I have a PhD in music theory (seriously), which turns out to be surprisingly useful for understanding complex systems and patterns.

## Tech I'm passionate about

**Languages**: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, SQL  
**AI/ML**: Multi-agent systems, RAG implementations, Clinical ML models  
**Backend**: Node.js, PostgreSQL, Healthcare data integration  
**Frontend**: Next.js, React, Clinical dashboards  
**Philosophy**: TDD, LLM-driven development, Quality gates, Modular architecture  

## Recent projects worth mentioning

🏥 **LongView Clinical Platform** - AI-powered clinical decision support transforming archived medical data  
🤖 **Agent Development Pipeline** - Multi-agent system for automated software development  
💰 **Financial Modeling Framework** - TDD-based production company analytics  
📊 **LDA Data Intelligence** - Healthcare data lakehouse with ML/AI capabilities
