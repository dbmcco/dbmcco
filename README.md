# I'm Braydon  ðŸ‘‹

Entrepreneur, systems thinker, and working at the intersection of healthcare technology, AI, and business transformation. PhD in music theory and composition; I run marathons, half and triathlons, which still surprises me since I used to think "only run when chased".

## Recent Work

**Healthcare Data Intelligence**: LongView (EHR integrated dataa presentation) platform strategy, implementation and go to market, transforming archived medical data from "the toxic waste dump of healthcare data" into clinical intelligence. I'm great at a party.

**AI Development Systems**: Building multi-agent frameworks that write better code than I do (since I'm not a trained developer). It's both fascinating and occasionally terrifying how well this works. Using TDD/lint/hooks to force genai into a coding box. Emerging signs of autonomous intelligence are wild. 

**Financial Modeling**: Developing Python frameworks for film and tv production company financial analysis with 88% test coverage . The entertainment industry runs on spreadsheets and handshakes.

**Knowledge Management**: Refining Obsidian â†’ Jekyll â†’ GitHub Pages workflows for efficient publishing. There's something deeply satisfying about writing once and having your ideas flow seamlessly without fighting with formatting.

## Some tools

**Languages & Tools**: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, SQL, React, Node.js, Docker (and occasionally English)  
**Architecture**: Modular design, API-first development, test-driven development (if it's not tested, it's broken)  
**AI/ML**: RAG implementations, multi-agent systems, clinical ML models  
**Data**: Healthcare data integration, ETL pipelines, data mesh architectures  


## Systems Thinking Approach

I didn't expect this, but music theory provides a framework for understanding complex systems - whether in software architecture, business processes, or product development. The mathematical patterns in Bach have surprising parallels to well-designed software architecture  - super [fascinating study](https://dash.harvard.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/4d1e447f-781e-400c-a7f3-bd3b09eb7d88/content) of chromaticism lead me to developing novel computational analysis approach to patient phenotyping.

## Beyond Technology

**Marathon Runner**: Finding clarity and problem-solving through distance running. Nothing good happens before 5 miles, and nothing good happens after 18.

**Continuous Learner**: Currently reading books on systems thinking, intellectual frameworks. And weird fiction.
